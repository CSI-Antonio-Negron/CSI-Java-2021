# Communicate with Console

[*Some commands vary on the Mac Shell.*](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/mac-terminal-commands-cheat-sheet/)

## Lets start by navigating through directories 
### Type the following commands into your console


* `dir` will Show contents of current directory
 
* `cd ..` will take you back one directory

* `cd CSI-Java-2021` will bring you back to the project directory (Assuming you went back one directory in the step before)

***(Hint)** After typing "`cd`" into the console, you may hit the `TAB` key to run through the options available in the directory. It also works as an auto-complete shortcut.*

* `cd Modules\Module2` will move you from
> C:\Users\user\Documents\CSI-Java-2021

to 

> C:\Users\user\Documents\CSI-Java-2021\Modules\Module2
